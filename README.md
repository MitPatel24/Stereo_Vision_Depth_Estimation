# 🎯 Depth Estimation of Ball Using Stereo Vision

##### *A Gradio-Powered Application with Interactive Controls*
---

## 📜 **Project Description**
This project implements stereo vision techniques to estimate the depth of a ball using two cameras. By leveraging computer vision principles such as HSV filtering, shape recognition, and triangulation, this system calculates the distance of a ball from the camera setup in real-time.

## 📂 **Features**  
- 🎥 Real-time video processing from two camera feeds.
- 🌈 HSV-based color filtering for precise object segmentation.
- 🔵 Detection of circular shapes using contour analysis.
- 📐 Depth estimation using triangulation principles.
- 📊 Display of depth information directly on video frames.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**   
* Ensure the following libraries are installed with the specified versions: 

    ```bash
        python 3.x
        opencv-python==4.10.0.84
        numpy==1.26.4
        imutils
        matplotlib


### **Installation**
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:MitPatel24/Stereo_Vision_Depth_Estimation.git
    cd <working-directory>

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 📋 **Usage**
1. Ensure you have two cameras connected to your system.
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
3. Adjust HSV thresholds in HSV_filter.py if necessary for your environment.
4. Adjust HSV thresholds in HSV_filter.py if necessary for your environment.
